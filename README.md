# Case Study: Hexagonal Architecture

This repository contains a case study of implementing the hexagonal architecture in a sample system.

## Overview

The objective of this case study is to demonstrate the application of hexagonal architecture principles in a software system. Hexagonal architecture, also known as ports and adapters architecture, is a software architecture pattern that aims to separate the core concerns of the system from external dependencies, making software more testable, maintainable, and evolvable.
